## üîÑ Lumo vs. Lumo: The Evolving Function Showdown! ü§ñ‚ö°


ü•ä Round 1: Lumo vs Lumo-api

üí¨ How It Works

Send Your Prompt ‚úâÔ∏è

Type in your initial question or topic
Let Lumo know what you're curious about

Set the Turns ‚öôÔ∏è

Choose how many back-and-forth exchanges you want
From quick chats to deep dives you're in control!

üîç Behind the Scenes

Our enhanced code works its magic by:

Analyzing responses in real-time
Identifying key topics and themes
Generating context-aware follow-up questions
Gracefully handling errors to maintain flow

üéØ Why It's Awesome


‚úÖ Natural Conversations: Feels more like talking to a friend than a bot

‚úÖ Smooth Transitions: Effortlessly moves between related topics

‚úÖ Error Resistant: Keeps the conversation going even when things get tricky

‚úÖ Customizable Length: You decide how long the chat should be

‚úÖ Engaging Interactions: Smart follow-ups make conversations more interesting


üí° Try It Out!


```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/send-automated-dialogue \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"initialPrompt": "what is proton lumo", "maxTurns": 30}'
```

Watch the Conversation Flow üåä

Sit back and enjoy the natural, engaging dialogue
See Lumo smoothly transition between topics
Witness intelligent follow-up questions that keep the conversation lively



## Troubleshooting ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Issue**: No response after sending a prompt.
  - **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in manually in the browser window launched by Puppeteer.

- **Issue**: Invalid token errors.
  - **Solution**: Ensure you are passing the correct token in the `Authorization` header.
